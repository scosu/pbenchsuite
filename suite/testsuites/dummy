# This file can configure everything that is essential for the testsuite.

[general]
# All options in this section are optional.


# min_runs max_runs define the minimum/maximum runs per test instance
min_runs = 6
#max_runs = 10

# relative_min/max_runs define the relative number of runs. So if the test
# defines min_runs = 3 and relative_min_runs = 2.5 that will result in
# min_runs * relative_min_runs = 7.5 => minimum 7 runs
# Total will be max(min_runs, relative_min_runs * test_min_runs)
#relative_min_runs = 1.0
#relative_max_runs = 1.0

# min_runtime and max_runtime define the minimum/maximum runtime in seconds,
# excluding the warmup runs.
#min_runtime = 234
#max_runtime = 3455

# the above repeating rules are checked in the following order:
# 1) min_runs
# 2) min_runtime
# 3) relative_min_runs
# 4) max_runtime
# 5) relative_max_runs
# 6) max_runs
# 7) relative_stderr
#
# So for example if the relative_min_runs condition is not met yet and the
# runtime is higher than max_runtime, so the test will still repeat, until
# relative_min_runs is fullfilled.


# warmup runs to heat up the caches before running the test. Default: 1
# Priority of warmup_runs definitions:
# 1) testsuite config test specific
# 2) testsuite config global
# 3) test config
#warmup_runs = 2
#relative_warmup_runs = 2.0
# The testsuite will execute max(warmup_runs, test_warmup_runs*relative_warmup_runs)
# warump runs before measurement

# == Config precedence ==
# The above absolut values may be defined in the testinstance sections in this
# file, in the general section of this file and in the test config. The precedence
# is ordered like this:
# testinstance > general > test



# relative_stderr is multiplied with the average result to get the maximal allowed
# standard error.
# Example:
# Average result is 20, stderr is 0.01. Then ptestsuite tries to reach a
# standard error less than 20*0.01=0.2. As soon as the standard error is small
# enough and the minimum runs are done, ptestsuite continues with the next test.
relative_stderr = 0.01

# Define the monitors that should run for this testsuite.(without .py at the end)
